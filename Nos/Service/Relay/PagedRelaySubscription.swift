/// This class manages a Filter and fetches events in reverse-chronological order as `loadMore()` is called. This
/// can be used to paginate a list of events. The underlying relay subscriptions will be deallocated when this object
/// goes out of scope.  
///
/// Paging in Nostr is very different from traditional HTTP paging, because we can't just ask for "the next 20 events
/// after index 100". Instead we have to use dates and ask for "the next 20 events older than X". Moreover because we
/// are fetching from a lot of relays the date X is different for every relay. `PagedRelaySubscription` abstracts away
/// these details, so the caller basically only needs to know what kinds of events they want from what relays, and then
/// call `loadMore()` whenever the user scrolls a page.
